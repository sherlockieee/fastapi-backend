<p>Hi {{name}},</p>
<p>
  The project that you created, {{project_name}} has passed it funding time but
  did not raise enough money.
</p>
<p>
  As of our policy, we will return all of the supporters' money back as the
  project did not reach its funding. Thus, you will not receive the money for
  the project.
</p>
<p>
  We understand that this is disappointing for you, but with more knowledge of
  crowdfunding now, maybe your next project is just around the corner. Do not
  hesitate to re-apply for another project!
</p>
<p>Thank you for making the world a better place!</p>
